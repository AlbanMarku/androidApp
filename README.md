# Android app project
Android application for tracking car journeys that tracks events such as aggressive driving, distance driven/walked and car battery usage.

Database handled by Postgres which is hosted on Heroku. Database requests written in Python using the Flask web framework.
# Usage
Application has limited functionality when emulating an Android phone. The speed of the user can not be calculated meaning events that track aggressive driving can not be tracked.
